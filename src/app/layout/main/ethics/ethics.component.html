                <h1>Code of Ethics</h1>
                <p>Buying life insurance is very hectic opaque and stressful. Protecting one’s family and their assets is on the minds
                    of millions of Canadians. Estate Nest Inc. provides instant, no-obligation affordable life insurance quotes, and their
                    advisors are honest, and they keep it simple. We make every effort to work in the client’s best interests. In particular,
                    client’s interests and their financial needs are taken high precedence and come before Estate Nest Inc.’s or its advisors’
                    best interests or the best interests of any Canadian life insurance company we represent, to the extent allowed by the
                    law.</p>

                    <h4 class="mt-4 mb-2">Relationship with Insurers:</h4>
                    <p>No insurer holds ownership or interest in the business of Estate Nest Inc, nor do Estate Nest Inc hold an interest
                        in any insurance company they represent. We are duly registered in the province of Alberta and Ontario offering
                        financial services products. Estate Nest Inc. is authorized to sell life insurance, simplified life insurance, living benefits
                        (critical insurance, disability insurance, health, drug, and dental plans), group benefits, and segregated investments in
                        the province of Alberta and Ontario, with plans to expand the license in British Columbia very soon.</p>

                        <h4 class="mt-4 mb-2">Compensation:</h4>
                        <p>If you choose to purchase a product through Estate Nest Inc, the company will receive remuneration from the
                            life insurance company that offers the product. Compensated by sales commission, may also receive renewal (or service)
                            commissions from the insurer where clients decide to keep the policy or the contract in-force. Estate Nest Inc may also
                            be eligible for additional compensation, such as bonuses, non-monetary benefits, and travel incentives, depending on
                            various factors such as the volume or persistency of the business that they place with a particular life insurance
                            company. The company may also receive compensation in the form of a referral fee for the recommendation of the
                                product.</p><a href="https://www.clhia.ca/">Canadian Life and Health Insurance Association Inc. CHLIA </a>
                                <p>As a part of our discussions pertaining to product requirements and selection, the amount of compensation
                                    received will not play any factor in the recommendations made to you, as those recommendations are solely based on
                                    your financial needs analysis [information for the financial situation of the clients are solely disclosed by the clients
                                    themselves which allows the advisors at Estate Nest Inc. to do their financial / insurance needs analysis]. Estate Nest Inc.
